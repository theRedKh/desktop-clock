# Desktop Clock Widget
 A cool desktop clock widget made with `React` + `Electron`
 
Mostly built as a fun project lol

## 🎯This project taught me:
 - How does `Electron` package apps
 - How do we control browser window settings and customize them
 - What is `pnpm` and how does it make my development process more efficient

## To make this project better, the next update will have:
 - Custom fonts
 - Final Package (.exe)
 - Potential `C++` conversion for easier system resource load

## Updates:
 - **version 1.0** - 

## Running it locally/Acessing:
- Version 1.0: clone the repo, open the folder in terminal and run `npm start`
(currently in development stage)
